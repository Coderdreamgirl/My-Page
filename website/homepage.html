      <h4>About Me</h4>
      <img src="amru.jpg" alt="A picture of Amru" id="myimage" >
      <p class="aboutme">I'm a high school student with a passion for coding. I love learning new things and meeting new people. I am a rising senior in the Business program at school. I want to start a business based on Artificial Intelligence one day. I love leading teams, and making presentations. I currently am set to lead the GWC Chapter at my school for next year. I am fun, jovial, and the entertainer of my friend circle. I am the one that makes everyone laugh. To those who know me, I am helping, kind, and inspirational.</p>
